    <p class="words">food sharing is a community that offers their service onlne through our website
    we dicovered that most people especially men when they go home dont cook or do not have a meal that the can eat
    this might be because of the poor state of the economy at large in this counrty.we decided to open up a website
  that anyone who has extra food can share with anyone who doesnt have any.</p>
